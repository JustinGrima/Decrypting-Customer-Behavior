### Implementation of Logistic Regression to Predict Subscription Term Deposit.

#### Dataset Overview

This project analyzes the "bank-full.csv" dataset, sourced from a Portuguese banking institution's marketing campaigns, to predict whether customers will subscribe to a term deposit. The dataset includes data from 17 marketing campaigns conducted between 2008 and 2010, with 45,211 observations and 17 variables, including customer demographic information, account balances, and past interactions with the bank.

#### Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing a binomial Generalized Linear Model (GLM) using logistic regression to predict customer subscription to term deposits. An extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to select significant variables, refine the model, and improve predictive accuracy. The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 90.30% and a ROC curve performance of 90.71%. The study also offers insights into the effectiveness of the bank's marketing campaign and suggests potential improvements to increase subscription rates.
